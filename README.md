# dotfiles
Here I'll save all my personal dotfiles, most of them to configure my linux environment quickly, since I usually change a lot the Distro that I'm using 
to try something new.

The files will be most for i3wm and i3-gaps, Polybar, NeoVim and some of other random stuff. It's possible that I use other people's code, and I'll try to 
remember to give credit for it.
